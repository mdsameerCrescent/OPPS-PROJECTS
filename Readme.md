# Java Swing OOP Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of beginner-to-intermediate level Java Swing projects, all built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. Each project is designed as a standalone Java application with clean UI and functional logic using Swing.

## Projects Included

### 1. To-Do List App (`TodoApp.java`)
A simple application to add, mark, and delete to-do tasks. It demonstrates the use of `JList`, events, and list models.

### 2. Calculator (`CalculatorApp.java`)
A basic calculator performing arithmetic operations using buttons and text fields. Covers event-driven programming.

### 3. Student Grade Manager (`GradeApp.java`)
Allows input of student names and grades, and calculates average. Demonstrates data encapsulation and GUI tables.

### 4. Login/Signup System (`LoginApp.java`)
A simple login/signup interface using Swing forms and internal data management. Uses OOP for user account handling.

### 5. Notepad Clone (`NotepadApp.java`)
A basic notepad text editor with open/save functionality using `JFileChooser`.

### 6. Tic-Tac-Toe (`TicTacToeApp.java`)
Two-player tic-tac-toe game with game-over detection and win-checking logic.

### 7. Currency Converter (`CurrencyConverterApp.java`)
Converts between different currencies using hardcoded exchange rates with dropdown selection.

### 8. Stopwatch/Timer (`StopwatchApp.java`)
Digital stopwatch with start, stop, and reset features. Demonstrates use of `javax.swing.Timer`.

### 9. Simple Chat Application (`ChatApp.java`)
A server-client chat app (local) demonstrating networking in Java with a Swing-based UI.

### 10. Alarm Clock (`AlarmClockApp.java`)
Takes a time input and triggers an alert when the system time matches it. Uses `Timer` and time parsing.

### 11. File Explorer (`FileExplorerApp.java`)
Open/save file chooser demo using `JFileChooser`. Demonstrates file handling in Swing.

### 12. BMI Calculator (`BMICalculatorApp.java`)
Calculates Body Mass Index based on user input. Outputs BMI and category (underweight, normal, etc.).

### 13. Digital Clock (`DigitalClockApp.java`)
Displays current system time, updating every second. Demonstrates time formatting and real-time UI updates.

### 14. Tic-Tac-Toe with AI (basic) (`TicTacToeAIApp.java`)
An enhanced version of tic-tac-toe. You play against a simple logic-based AI.
